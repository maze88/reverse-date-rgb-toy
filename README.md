# Reverse date RGB toy
Welcome to reverse date RGB toy!
I made this as a coding exercise, because I found it funner to play with Python than with silly trends on social media...
The origin of the idea came from a trend on social media where one is told to look up the reversed values of the numbers of their date of birth as RGB values, in order to get "their color".

## The ~~silly~~ features:
* Print all date combinations (a whole century).
* Input any specific date.
* Check a randomly selected date.

## Technical stuff
### Coding techniques demonstrated:
* Usage of modules
* String methods
* Type convertions
* Function mapping
* Default and optional function parameters
* Recursion
* Exception handling
* Input validation
* Classes
* Use of terminal dimensions (width/height)
* Colored text
* List comprehention
* Special unicode characters
* While loops, with continue statements

### Ideas for improvement:
* Input validation for leap years.
