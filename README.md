# Reverse date RGB toy
Welcome to reverse date RGB toy!
I made this as a coding exercise, because I found it funner to play with Python than with silly trends on social media...
The origin of the idea came from a post on social media where one is told to look up the reversed values of their date of birth as RGB values, in order to get "their birth color".

## The ~~silly~~ features:
* Print all date combinations (a whole century).
* Input a specific date.
* Check a randomly selected date.

## Technical stuff
### Notable coding techniques demonstrated:
* Type convertions
* Function mapping
* Default and optional function parameters
* Recursion
* Exception handling
* Input validation
* Classes
* Use of terminal dimensions (width/height)
* Colored text
* List comprehention
* Special unicode characters

### Ideas for improvement:
* Management of leap years in input validation.
