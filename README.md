# Reverse date RGB toy
Welcome to reverse date RGB toy!
I made this as a coding exercise, because I found it funner to play with Python than with silly trends on social media...
The origin of the idea came from a trend on social media where you take the numbers of your date of birth and look up their reversed values as RGB values.

## The ~~silly~~ features:
* Option in input any specific date.
* See a randomly selected date.
* Print all date combinations (all days in past century).

## Technical stuff
### Techniques demonstrated:
* Recursion
* Exception handling
* Input validation
* Colored text
* Type convertions
* Function mapping
* Default and optional function parameters
* Using terminal dimensions (width/height)
* Classes
* While loops (with continue statements)
* List comprehention
* Special unicode characters
* String methods
* Importing modules

### Options for improvement:
* Further input validation for months shorter than 31 days.
* Handle in order of magnitude of number when reversing a numeric string. For example: 100 should become '001', not '1'.
